* Description
  Due to time constraints, this does not address adding comments to tweets. It is only able to register/login/view tweets/add tweets/live updating tweets
  
* Usage
** Frontend
   #+begin_src bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm start
   #+end_src

** Backend
   #+begin_src bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python app.py
   #+end_src

* Deployment
  (Note that both containers will be spun up, but won't connect to each other. I didn't finish bridging both networks due to time constraints)
  This can be deployed to CI server or to production easily using Docker by doing the following:
  
  #+begin_src bash
    docker-compose up
  #+end_src
